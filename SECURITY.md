# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately by emailing **eugen-goebel@hotmail.de**.

Please do not file public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities, as this could expose users to risk before a fix is available.

## Response Time

I aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and provide an initial assessment within 14 days.

## Supported Versions

This is a portfolio project; only the latest commit on `main` is supported.

## API Key Handling

This project uses the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. Never commit your API key — use the provided `.env.example` as a template and keep your real `.env` file out of version control (it is gitignored).
